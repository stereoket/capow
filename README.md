C.A.P.O.W could stand for one of the following:


* Comics: Accessible Publishing Online WebEngine
* Comics Augmented Publishing Online WebEngine
* Comics Authored Publishing Online WebEngine
* Comics Architectural Publishing Online WebEngine

I am hoping there can be some discussion about this before settling on the correct explanation of the Acronym.

Big Thanks to Stephanie Hobson for name suggestions :)
