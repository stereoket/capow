###Current state of web comics:###

- currently very bloggy - 1 comic a week, under pressure with a timeline
- page scan, title, indexes + thumbnails, but obfusicates the urls, makes the comics unable to be viewed easily
- the creative form is not being translated into the web
 
Try to reach out to other people in the industry who also have this problem to create something that everyone can contribute to and use.

Reached out to:

- Greg Pak - writer with marvel (encouraged to use vision machine as its CC body of work)
	- http://www.visionmachine.net 
- Slymongoose
	- http://www.defendini.com/bib/ responsive, but bubbles and lettering are still difficulties
- http://abelincolnvampirehunter.com

sound, parallax, elements of panels to fit absolute positioning, triggering audio effects, single axis scrolling approach, story board + painted art.

##Modes:##

1. motion in 1 axis (layout problem with panel orientation?)
need sensible sequence of flow in both portrait and landscape

2. infinite canvas

Multi-axis mode

3. paralax
	hobolobo.net
	what is a "page"? or there might be "too much" paralax, leading to headaches, etc
	intent of artist vs the experience of reader - difficult to retain control over the experience

=====

Vision Machine iPad app as a first step into experimenting with the medium. Large budget so it's an exception rather than the norm. But worth investigating into the tropes and concepts behind the app.
